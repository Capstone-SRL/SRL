This folder contains codes for cluster analysis
### Clustering analysis.ipynb
It's the file that I used for cluster analysis\\
It checked all selected cluster algorithms
### Clusterings.py
It's a function package which contains four alternative clustering methods\\
For future use, import this package into code, so that could use the four clusters directly.
### Test.py
It's the provided modular codes for future use
* step 1 - import data and select features
* step 2 - (optional) hyperparameter tunning
          Since some clustering methods have predefined parameters which would impact the performance of cluster, this part is designed for parameter selection.
          The provided codes is an example of mean shift
* step 3 - visualize the clustering result throgh pari-wise PCA data
